README:

	This Python code implements Greedy Best First Search and A* search algorithms to find the shortest path from a start node to a goal node in a 2D grid.

Input:

	Graph: 2D grid representing the environment with obstacles ('#') and free paths ('.').
	Start Node: Initial position.
	End Node: Goal position.
	
Output:

	Prints the minimum time from the start node to the goal node using the greedy best first search and A* algorithm.

Usage:

	Run the script using the following command:
		```
		python3 question2.py
		```

Note:

	The grid is reversed before processing to match coordinate conventions.
