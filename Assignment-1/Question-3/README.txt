Maze Traversal with A* Search & Weighted A* search
This Python program finds the minimum cost path from a starting point to a goal point in a grid-based maze using A* Search and Weighted A* Search algorithms.


Instructions to Run and see the output.

1) Make sure you have python installed in your system.

2) When you run the program (in terminal or in IDE like VS CODE), specify the input in following format :
a) First line should be two single spaced integers. First integer represents number of rows(N) and second integer represents the number of columns(M) in the maze.
b) Next, N lines follow, where each line has M characters without any spaces, representing the cell terrain.

3) Make sure the input maze has exactly one 'S' and 'F' state. representing the start and finish for search algorithm.

4) Once the input has been entered correctly, the output for both A* search and weighted A* search will be displayed in the next line in the same terminal.

5) Suppose you want to change weight in Weighted A*, then you can do so by accessing the source file. The third last line specifies the weight just before calling the weighted A* function.


NOTE : The program includes comments for each section to provide detailed explanations of the code.
